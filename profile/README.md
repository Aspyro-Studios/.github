# Aspyro's Studios presentation

Hello everyone! ‚ú®

What you can see here is the GitHub organization created to host my **gaming projects**!

For the time being, I - Aspyro - am alone in it. But if you are interested in giving me a hand, do not hesitate to! ü§ù

## What can you expect?

Video games, of course! üïπÔ∏è

But that is not all. In fact, the games I want to create will all have a common objective: *make people interested in subjects they wouldn't come accross or get interested in otherwise*!

A pretty ambitious project, right?

## Current projects

There already are two main projects that i'm working on at the moment:

- A "escape the maze" kind of game treating the subject of alcoholism;
- A Role-Playing Game about mathematics' learning, whether they are basic or advanced mathematics.

I'm convinced learning and sensibilization can be fun, if treated right.

## Support the Studios

For the time being, there is no way of supporting Aspyro's Studios, except for helping me publicizing my work and giving me a hand when needed.

That's all for this presentation of Aspyro's Studios.

I hope to make you discover new fun things soon !
